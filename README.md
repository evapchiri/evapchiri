## A 🤏 about me

🌍 I'm originally from Spain but have lived in the UK for 7 years - who would've thought!

📖 My background is Anthropology and I am doing a Software Engineering Bootcamp with (the amazing) CodeFirstGirls 

❤️ I love studying human behaviour & interaction with technology ⭐

🌱 I am learning how to code apps end-to-end & Full Stack integration

🎯 My goal is to understand how to craft human-centred technology from the inside out!
